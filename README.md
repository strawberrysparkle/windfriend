This is a Python 2.7 lambda function that you can call from an Alexa skill to find out the wind speed in any US city that
Weather Underground recognizes. Sometimes you need to know if the wind is gonna blow your long hair in your face.

The Alexa SDK includes a lot of weather conditions but not wind, so this function calls a third-party API that *will* tell you the
wind speed.

You can create a free account with Weather Underground and get an API key (just insert it in the appropriate location in the code)
that'll give you 500 calls a month. (This is why I haven't published the skill on the Alexa store.)
